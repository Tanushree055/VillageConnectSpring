                            Shri Bhaskar Pere, the Sarpanch of Patoda Gram
                            Panchayat, has transformed his village, located
                            about 13 kilometers from Aurangabad, into a model of
                            cleanliness and innovation. Under his leadership,
                            Patoda has received numerous awards, including the
                            ‘Nirmal Gram’ award and two honors from the
                            President of India. The village offers free services
                            like dinner, milk, drinking water, and internet to
                            its residents, provided they adhere to the
                            Panchayat’s rules. Patoda is free of open
                            defecation, boasts paved roads, waste management
                            systems, and solar-powered amenities. The village
                            also promotes social unity through community meals
                            and Dhobi Ghats for women. Shri Pere’s visionary
                            leadership and commitment to sustainability have set
                            a high standard for rural development, making Patoda
                            a model village for others to emulate.

                            Hiware Bazar, a once-drought-stricken village in
                            Maharashtra, India, has transformed from a dire
                            state of poverty and ecological collapse into a
                            model of agricultural and community revival. Through
                            effective watershed management, reforestation, and a
                            shift to sustainable farming practices, the village
                            has turned its fortunes around, with farmers now
                            earning significantly more than the national average
                            and the entire community thriving. This turnaround,
                            spearheaded by Popatrao Pawar and supported by local
                            efforts, has not only revitalized agriculture but
                            also improved education, healthcare, and
                            infrastructure, making Hiware Bazar a beacon of hope
                            and a replicable model for other drought-prone
                            regions in India.

                            In Piplantri, Rajasthan, a village has been
                            rejuvenated through the vision of Shyam Sunder
                            Paliwal, inspired by his daughter's tragic death in
                            2007. Paliwal initiated a program where 111 trees
                            are planted for every newborn girl, combining
                            environmental and gender empowerment goals. This
                            initiative has led to over 350,000 trees being
                            planted, improved water management, and enhanced
                            attitudes towards women. Additionally, the program
                            opens bank accounts for girls and supports their
                            education, increasing female school enrollment and
                            shifting local perceptions of girls from burdens to
                            valued members of the community. Piplantri's
                            transformation showcases how community-driven
                            efforts can effectively revitalize both
                            environmental and social values.

                            Odanthurai Gram Panchayat in Tamil Nadu has become a
                            model for sustainable energy. The village generates
                            its own power with a 350-kw wind turbine,
                            established in 2006 under the leadership of
                            Panchayat President Shanmugam. This initiative was
                            financed through a combination of government support
                            and a bank loan, making it the first power project
                            by a local body in India. The wind farm produces 7.5
                            lakh units of electricity annually, exceeding the
                            village's needs and generating income by selling the
                            surplus. Additionally, Odanthurai has implemented a
                            9kW biomass gasifier for water pumping, saving 70%
                            on costs, along with solar lighting and biogas
                            systems. These efforts demonstrate how strategic
                            energy planning can enhance efficiency and
                            sustainability, setting an example for other
                            communities.

                            out is its unique sense of community that has helped
                            the village drive transformational change without a
                            leader to oversee. In other words, this village is
                            the only one of its kind as it has functioned
                            without a sarpanch since independence. Here, every
                            community member is a leader in their own right and
                            takes ownership of efficiently improving the village
                            infrastructure.
                            Thanks to this unique model, today the village
                            boasts an exemplary sanitation infrastructure, with
                            almost every house having its own toilet, a common
                            toilet complex for social gatherings, underground
                            sewage lines and a substantial number of biogas
                            plants. With the help of these facilities, they

                        MGNREGA offers a transformative promise: a legal

                        of 100 days of employment annually to every rural
                        household
                        in India. This safety net helps alleviate poverty
                        and
                        supports families during tough economic times. The
                        program's
                        core mission is to boost rural livelihoods through
                        sustainable development, creating assets like water
                        conservation structures and roads that uplift entire
                        communities.

                        Designed to be inclusive and demand-driven, MGNREGA
                        ensures
                        that villagers can request work, with the government
                        obliged
                        to provide employment within 15 days. Women play a
                        crucial
                        role, making up at least one-third of the workforce,
                        promoting gender equality and empowerment.

                        Transparency and accountability are key, with social
                        audits
                        and open access to project information, fostering
                        community
                        involvement. Technology enhances efficiency, with
                        wages
                        directly deposited into workers' bank accounts,
                        minimizing
                        corruption and ensuring timely payments.

                        MGNREGA isn't just a job scheme; it's a pathway to a

                        designed to provide a pucca house to every rural
                        household by 2024. This program builds on the foundation
                        of the Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY) with enhanced financial
                        support and improved standards.

                        Under PMAY-G, beneficiaries receive up to ₹1.20 lakh for
                        house construction in plain areas and ₹1.30 lakh in
                        hilly or difficult terrains. The funding is shared
                        between central and state governments and includes labor
                        support from the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural
                        Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).

                        The program covers construction costs and integrates
                        essential facilities such as toilets, piped water, and
                        electricity, achieved through collaborations with other
                        government schemes.

                        PMAY-G emphasizes transparency with a robust grievance
                        redressal system and real-time monitoring via AwaasSoft
                        and AwaasApp. It also focuses on high-quality
                        construction by providing trained masons and using
                        disaster-resilient designs suited to local conditions.
                        Beneficiaries can access up to ₹70,000 in institutional
                        finance, facilitating smoother project execution.

                        Launched in 2000, the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak
                        Yojana
                        (PMGSY) is revolutionizing rural connectivity across
                        India
                        by building all-weather roads to unconnected
                        villages. This
                        ambitious program aims to connect every habitation
                        with over
                        500 residents in plains and over 250 in hilly
                        regions. By
                        December 2017, PMGSY had already connected 82% of
                        targeted
                        habitations, with remaining projects on track for
                        completion
                        by March 2019.

                        Fully funded by the central government, with state
                        contributions since 2015, PMGSY enhances rural
                        infrastructure, boosting accessibility and economic
                        opportunities. It employs the cutting-edge Online
                        Management, Monitoring, and Accounting System
                        (OMMAS) to
                        track and manage progress transparently.

                        The scheme's impact is profound—improved roads have
                        transformed village life by facilitating better
                        market
                        access and mobility. While the immediate focus is on
                        connectivity, PMGSY also supports long-term economic
                        development, including the Road Connectivity Project
                        for
                        Left Wing Extremism Affected Areas, extended through
                        March
                        2023.

                        For rural communities, PMGSY isn't just about roads;
                        it's
                        about opening doors to new opportunities and
                        improving
                        livelihoods. The program continues to evolve,
                        driving
                        progress and making a tangible difference in rural

                    <div class="scheme-para">
                        Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY), launched to bring
                        Mahatma Gandhi's vision of holistic rural development to
                        life, aims to improve the quality of life in selected
                        Gram Panchayats by enhancing basic amenities, increasing
                        productivity, and providing better livelihood
                        opportunities. The program focuses on upgrading
                        infrastructure such as roads, housing, clean drinking
                        water, sanitation facilities, and reliable electricity.
                        Additionally, it seeks to improve educational
                        institutions and healthcare services, recognizing these
                        as essential for sustainable development.

                        Economic development is a cornerstone of SAGY, promoting
                        sustainable agricultural practices, skill development,
                        and vocational training to boost productivity and
                        provide better livelihoods. By supporting local
                        entrepreneurship and micro-enterprises, the program aims
                        to create jobs within the community and reduce distress
                        migration. The initiative also emphasizes social justice
                        by eliminating bonded and child labor, ensuring access
                        to rights and entitlements, and fostering community
                        participation and the involvement of women and
                        marginalized groups in decision-making processes.

                        SAGY's comprehensive approach aims to create model Gram
                        Panchayats that can serve as examples for others to
                        follow, demonstrating successful development practices
                        and encouraging replication. By focusing on
                        infrastructure, economic opportunities, and social
                        development, SAGY strives to build cohesive, empowered
                        rural communities where every citizen enjoys an improved
                        quality of life.
